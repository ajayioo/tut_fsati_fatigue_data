The enhanced modified Z-score preprocessing method effectively reduces noise and outliers in EEG data, significantly improving the quality of features for fatigue classification. The DBN component is used for unsupervised feature extraction, while the LSTM component captures temporal dependencies in the data, enhancing the accuracy of the model. Experimental results showed that the proposed model achieved an overall accuracy of 82.41%, a specificity of 65.10%, and an F1score of 84.90%, indicating robust performance in classifying different driver fatigue states.

This paper, which is focused on image processing technology and research on driver fatigue, proposes a driver fatigue detection model based on image processing, and introduces various methods of identifying driver fatigue. It also discusses various algorithms, such as the Hough transform, AdaBoost, and PERCLOS algorithms, which can recognize a driver’s eyes and skin color. The experimental section of this paper explains the proposed driver fatigue detection model in many aspects. The analysis section analyzes eye closure detection, PERCLOS detection, and detection rate with regard to different algorithms used to detect driver behavior, the influence of spectacles on detection, and the success rate of different algorithms under different degrees of illumination. The PERCLOS value of the tester obtained in the “awakened” state is significantly smaller than the PERCLOS value obtained in the “fatigued” state. For example, the value of Tester 1 in time period 1 is 0.173 when awake, and the value in the same time period when fatigued is 0.523. The change in the percentage of eye closure is closely related to the degree of fatigue of the human body, and usually shows a positive correlation. Comprehensive analysis shows that the proposed image processing technology can effectively realize facial recognition. Therefore, the state of the driver’s eyes, limbs and other parts can be recognized by this technology, and the driver’s state of fatigue can be accurately assessed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""AJAYI""=>""Included""} | USER-NOTES: {""AJAYI""=>[""Behavioral"", ""Image Processing""]}",10.22967/HCIS.2022.12.017,,,

At other times, when the driver is not fatigued, the interface properties are optimized for aesthetics and pleasure. In this way, the adaptive interface provides a warning to the driver while she is fatigued along with the routine essential information. We take a multimedia approach to measure fatigue by analysing the driver behaviour. The system captures driver behaviour with four media streams that capture: angular velocity of steering wheel, force on brake pedal, force on gas pedal, and grip force. These continuous media stream are fused together with other contextual parameters to detect fatigue. In the experiments, we evaluate two fusion techniques and 16 media stream combinations.

For that purpose, a broad cross-country questionnaire from the ESRA2 survey was used. The questionnaire is related to self-declared beliefs, perception, and attitudes towards a wide range of traffic safety topics. Initially, a binary logistic regression model was trained to provide causal insights on which variables affect the likelihood that a driver engaged in driving while fatigued. Drivers reporting driving under the influence of drugs, fatigue, or alcohol, as well as speeding, safety, and texting while driving or drivers who were more acceptable of fatigued driving were more likely to have recently driven while fatigued. In contrast, acceptability of other hazardous behaviours, namely mobile phone use and drunk driving, was negatively correlated with fatigued driving behaviour, as were more responsible driver perspectives overall.

Numerous approaches have been proposed to address the challenge of fatigue detection, aiming to identify signs of fatigue and alert the individual. This paper introduces an approach to human mental fatigue assessment based on the application of machine learning techniques to the video of a working operator. For validation purposes, the approach was applied to a dataset, “Human Fatigue Assessment Based on Video Data” (HFAVD) integrating video data with features computed by using our computer vision deep learning models. The incorporated features encompass head movements represented by Euler angles (roll, pitch, and yaw), vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate), and eye and mouth states (blinking and yawning). The integration of these features eliminates the need for the manual calculation or detection of these parameters, and it obviates the requirement for sensors and external devices, which are commonly employed in existing datasets. The main objective of our work is to advance research in fatigue detection, particularly in work and academic settings. For this reason, we conducted a series of experiments by utilizing machine learning techniques to analyze the dataset and assess the fatigue state based on the features predicted by our models. The results reveal that the random forest technique consistently achieved the highest accuracy and F1-score across all experiments, predominantly exceeding 90%.

Results: Driver fatigue was prevalent among professional drivers, and it was even more serious for taxi drivers. Taxi drivers reported more frequent fatigue experiences and were involved in more accidents. Among the contributing factors to fatigue, prolonged driving time was the most important factor identiﬁed by both driver groups. Importantly, the reason for the engagement in prolonged driving was neither due to the lack of awareness concerning the serious outcome of fatigue driving nor because of their poor detection of fatigue. The most probable reason was the optimism bias, as a result of which these professional drivers thought that fatigue was more serious for other drivers than for themselves, and they thought that they were effective in counteracting the effect of fatigue on their driving performance. Moreover, truck drivers tended to employ methods that require stopping to counteract fatigue, whereas taxi drivers preferred methods that were simultaneous with driving. Although both driver groups considered taking a nap as one of the most effective means to address fatigue, this method was not commonly used.

The scarcity of electroencephalogram (EEG) data, coupled with individual and scenario variations, leads to considerable challenges in real-world EEG-based driver fatigue detection. We propose a domain adaptation method that utilizes EEG data collected from a laboratory to supplement real-world EEG data and constructs a cross-scenario and cross-subject driver fatigue detection model for real-world scenarios. Approach. First, we collect EEG data from subjects participating in a driving experiment conducted in both laboratory and real-world scenarios. To address the issue of data scarcity, we build a real-world fatigued driving detection model by integrating the real-world data with the laboratory data. Then, we propose a method named cross-scenario and cross-subject domain adaptation (CS2DA), which aims to eliminate the domain shift problem caused by individual variances and scenario differences. Adversarial learning is adopted to extract the common features observed across different subjects within the same scenario. The multikernel maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) method is applied to further minimize scenario differences. Additionally, we propose a conditional MK-MMD constraint to better utilize label information. Finally, we use seven rules to fuse the predicted labels. Main results. We evaluate the CS2DA method through extensive experiments conducted on the two EEG datasets created in this work: the SEED-VLA and the SEED-VRW datasets. Different domain adaptation methods are used to construct a real-world fatigued driving detection model using data from laboratory and real-world scenarios, as well as a combination of both. Our findings show that the proposed CS2DA method outperforms the existing traditional and adversarial learning-based domain adaptation approaches.

This paper studies six DL models for driver drowsiness detection: four configurations of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), two custom configurations as well as the architectures designed by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) (i.e. VGG16 and VGG19); a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

The performance of the DL models was measured with respect to accuracy, F1-Score, precision, negative class precision, recall and specificity. When comparing the performance of DL models trained on datasets with and without DA in aggregation, it was found that all metrics were improved. After removing outliers from the results, it was found that the average improvement in both accuracy and F1 score due to DA was +4.3%.

Furthermore, the problem of incorrect detection due to facial expression is still not well addressed. In this article, a model based on BP neural network and time cumulative effect was proposed to solve these problems. Experimental data were used to carry out this work and validate the proposed method. Firstly, the Adaboost algorithm was applied to detect faces, and the Kalman ﬁlter algorithm was used to trace the face movement. Then, a cascade regression tree-based method was used to detect the 68 facial landmarks and an improved method combining key points and image processing was adopted to calculate the eye aspect ratio (EAR). After that, a BP neural network model was developed and trained by selecting three characteristics: the longest period of continuous eye closure, number of yawns, and percentage of eye closure time (PERCLOS), and then the detection results without and with facial expressions were discussed and analyzed. Finally, by introducing the Sigmoid function, a fatigue detection model considering the time accumulation effect was established, and the drivers’ fatigue state was identiﬁed segment by segment through the recorded video. Compared with the traditional BP neural network model, the detection accuracies of the proposed model without and with facial expressions increased by 3.3% and 8.4%, respectively. The number of incorrect detections in the awake state also decreased obviously.

Different threshold values can be set for the two kinds of drivers individually. The entropy-based features, namely, the wavelet entropy (WE), the peak-to-peak value of ApEn (PP-ApEn), and the peak-to-peak value of sample entropy (PP-SampEn), were extracted from the collected signals to estimate the driving fatigue stages. We proposed WE in a sliding window (WES), PP-ApEn in a sliding window (PP-ApEnS), and PP-SampEn in a sliding window (PP-SampEnS) for real-time analysis of driver fatigue. The real-time features obtained by WE, PP-ApEn, and PP-SampEn with sliding window were applied to artiﬁcial neural network for training and testing the system, which gives four situations for the fatigue level of the subjects, namely, normal state, mild fatigue, mood swing, and excessive fatigue.

However, with the advent of deep learning algorithms, a signiﬁcant amount of research has also been conducted to predict and analyze driver’s behavior or action related information using neural network algorithms.

Driver drowsiness detection involves three methodologies namely face detection, eye detection, drowsiness detection. Face detection technique is used to detect the driver’s face by extracting the facial features using Haar Cascade Classifier Algorithm also it detects the person’s eye region. This paper proposed to Identifying Eye Aspect Ratio (I-EAR) method to identify the eye closure of vehicle’s driver. If the driving person’s eye is closed for minimum of 40 frames or eye blink ratio is less than 8 per minute, then the proposed system identifies that the vehicle driving person is drowsy. Consequently, it began to alert sound intimation that vehicle driver is drowsy. This alert may help the drivers as a wakeup call to take an immediate action by taking rest/refreshment and continue to drive safely.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""AJAYI""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong study design | USER-NOTES: {""AJAYI""=>[""no empirical validation""]}",10.1109/ICICCS56967.2023.10142501,,,

Numerous methods exist for drowsiness detection, including Subjective, Vehicle, Behavioral, and Physiological approaches. Among these, Physiological methods, particularly those utilizing Electroencephalogram (EEG) data combined with artificial intelligence, have proven effective in detecting drowsiness. These methods excel in capturing physiological changes in the body during drowsiness and the potential for gathering information from the human brain during this state.

Twenty participants completed a driving scenario as well as several measures of fatigue in ﬁve testing sessions across a night of sleep deprivation. Each simulated highway driving session lasted 20 min, and was analyzed for lateral lane position variability and vehicle heading difference variability with two statistical methods. Fatigue measures monitored reaction time, attention, and oculomotor movement. The results showed that examining lane heading difference using the absolute value of the raw data detected driving variability better across the night than other statistical models. The results from the fatigue measures indicated an increase in reaction time and response lapses, as well as a decrease in oculomotor reactivity across the night.

We used metaanalytical methods to explore the pooled effect sizes of different cardiac indices of fatigue, their heterogeneity, and the consistency of their responses across studies. Our large pool of studies (N = 39) allowed us to stratify the results across on-road and simulator studies.

Collected EEG signals were ﬁrst decomposed into delta-range, theta-range, alpha-range and beta-range by wavelet packet transform (WPT). Unlike other approaches, a multi-channel network construction method based on Phase Lag Index (PLI) was then proposed in this paper. Finally, the functional connectivity between alert state (at the beginning of the drive) and fatigue state (at the end of the drive) in multiple frequency bands were analyzed. The results indicate that functional connectivity of the brain area was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between alert and fatigue states, especially in alpha-range and beta-range. Particularly, the frontal-to-parietal functional connectivity was weakened. Meanwhile, lower clustering coeﬃcient (C) values and higher characteristic path length (L) values were observed in fatigue state in comparison with alert state.

The challenge of driver fatigue detection involves balancing the efficiency and accuracy of the detection process. While various detection methods are available, electroencephalography (EEG) is considered the gold standard due to its high precision in terms of detecting fatigue. However, deep learning models for EEG-based fatigue detection are limited by their large numbers of parameters and low computational efficiency levels, making it difficult to implement them on mobile devices. Methods: To overcome this challenge, an attention-based Ghost-LSTM neural network (AGL-Net) is proposed for EEG-based fatigue detection in this paper. AGL-Net utilizes an attention mechanism to focus on relevant features and incorporates Ghost bottlenecks to efficiently extract spatial EEG fatigue information. Temporal EEG fatigue features are extracted using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. We establish two types of models: regression and classification models. In the regression model, we use linear regression to obtain regression values. In the classification model, we classify features based on the predicted values obtained from regression. Results: AGL-Net exhibits improved computational efficiency and a more lightweight design than existing deep learning models, as evidenced by its floating-point operations per second (FLOPs) and Params values of 2.67 M and 103,530, respectively.

Specifically, we design a two-stage training strategy to progressively select the key contributing channels with the guidance of interpretability. We first train a teacher network in the first stage using full-head channel EEG data. Then we apply the class activation mapping (CAM) to the trained teacher model to highlight the high-contributing EEG channels and further propose a channel voting scheme to select the top N contributing EEG channels. Finally, we train a student network with the selected channels of EEG data in the second stage for driver drowsiness detection. Experiments are designed on a public dataset, and the results demonstrate that our method is highly applicable and can significantly improve the performance of cross-subject driver drowsiness detection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""AJAYI""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong study design | USER-NOTES: {""AJAYI""=>[""No empirical validation""]}",10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10341126,,,

Implementation of an internet of things (IoT) system capable of alerting fatigued drivers has the potential to substantially reduce road fatalities and associated issues. Often referred to as the internet of medical things (IoMT), this system leverages a combination of biosensors, actuators, detectors, cloud-based and edge computing, machine intelligence, and communication networks to deliver reliable performance and enhance quality of life in smart societies.     Methods: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals offer potential insights into fatigue detection. However, accurately identifying fatigue from brain signals is challenging due to inter-individual EEG variability and the difficulty of collecting sufficient data during periods of exhaustion. To address these challenges, a novel evolutionary optimization method combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and XGBoost, termed CNN-XGBoost Evolutionary Learning, was proposed to improve fatigue identification accuracy. The research explored various subbands of decomposed EEG data and introduced an innovative approach of transforming EEG recordings into RGB scalograms. These scalogram images were processed using a 2D Convolutional Neural Network (2DCNN) to extract essential features, which were subsequently fed into a dense layer for training.     Results: The resulting model achieved a noteworthy accuracy of 99.80% on a substantial driver fatigue dataset, surpassing existing methods.     Conclusion: By integrating this approach into an IoT framework, researchers effectively addressed previous challenges and established an artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) infrastructure for critical driving conditions. This IoT-based system optimizes data processing, reduces computational complexity, and enhances overall system performance, enabling accurate and timely detection of fatigue in extreme driving environments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""AJAYI""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong study design | USER-NOTES: {""AJAYI""=>[""No empirical validation""]}",10.34172/bi.30586,,,

Cardiac monitoring and heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is a candidate method for early and accurate detection of driver sleepiness. This study has 2 objectives: to evaluate the (1) suitability of different preprocessing strategies for detecting and removing outlier heartbeats and spectral transformation of HRV signals and their impact of driver sleepiness assessment and (2) relation between common HRV indices and subjective sleepiness reported by a large number of drivers in real driving situations, for the first time.     Methods: The study analyzed >3,500 5-min driving epochs from 76 drivers on a public motorway in Sweden. The electrocardiograph (ECG) data were recorded in 3 studies designed to evaluate the physiological differences between awake and sleepy drivers. The drivers reported their perceived level of sleepiness according to the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) every 5 min. Two standard methods were used for identifying outlier heartbeats: (1) percentage change (PC), where outliers were defined as interbeat intervals deviating >30% from the mean of the four previous intervals and (2) standard deviation (SD), where outliers were defined as interbeat interval deviating >4 SD from the mean interval duration in the current epoch. Three standard methods were used for spectral transformation, which is needed for deriving HRV indices in the frequency domain: (1) Fourier transform; (2) autoregressive model; and (3) Lomb-Scargle periodogram. Different preprocessing strategies were compared regarding their impact on derivation of common HRV indices and their relation to KSS data distribution, using box plots and statistical tests such as analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student’s t test.     Results: The ability of HRV indices to discriminate between alert and sleepy drivers does not differ significantly depending on which outlier detection and spectral transformation methods are used. As expected, with increasing sleepiness, the heart rate decreased, whereas heart rate variability overall increased. Furthermore, HRV parameters representing the parasympathetic branch of the autonomous nervous system increased. An unexpected finding was that parameters representing the sympathetic branch of the autonomous nervous system also increased with increasing KSS level. We hypothesize that this increment was due to stress induced by trying to avoid an incident, because the drivers were in real driving situations.     Conclusions: The association of HRV indices to KSS did not depend on the preprocessing strategy. No preprocessing method showed superiority for HRV association to driver sleepiness. This was also true for combinations of methods for frequency domain HRV indices. The results prove clear relationships between HRV indices and perceived sleepiness. Thus, HRV analysis shows promise for driver sleepiness detection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""AJAYI""=>""Included""} | USER-NOTES: {""AJAYI""=>[""Statistical Model"", ""Physiological"", ""HRV""]}",10.1080/15389588.2018.1548766,,,

Therefore, a dynamic fatigue detection model based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is proposed in this paper. Driver fatigue can be estimated by this model in a probabilistic way using various physiological and contextual information. Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electromyogram (EMG), and respiration signals were simultaneously recorded by wearable sensors and sent to computer by Bluetooth during the real driving. From these physiological information, fatigue likelihood can be achieved using kernel distribution estimate at different time sections. Contextual information offered by speciﬁc environmental factors were used as prior of fatigue.

EEG is becoming increasingly useful in the measuring fatigue state. Manual interpretation of EEG signals is impossible, so an effective method for automatic detection of EEG signals is crucial needed.     Method: In order to evaluate the complex, unstable, and non-linear characteristics of EEG signals, four feature sets were computed from EEG signals, in which fuzzy entropy (FE), sample entropy (SE), approximate Entropy (AE), spectral entropy (PE), and combined entropies (FE + SE + AE + PE) were included. All these feature sets were used as the input vectors of AdaBoost classiﬁer, a boosting method which is fast and highly accurate. To assess our method, several experiments including parameter setting and classiﬁer comparison were conducted on 28 subjects. For comparison, Decision Trees (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) classiﬁers are used.     Results: The proposed method (combination of FE and AdaBoost) yields superior performance than other schemes.

Its main challenge lies in the problem of how to identify the driver's fatigue state accurately. Existing detection methods include yawning and blinking based on facial expressions and physiological signals. Still, lighting and the environment affect the detection results based on facial expressions. In contrast, the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal is a physiological signal that directly responds to the human mental state, thus reducing the impact on the detection results. This paper proposes a log-Mel spectrogram and Convolution Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) model based on EEG to implement driver fatigue detection. This structure allows the advantages of the different networks to be exploited to overcome the disadvantages of using them individually. The process is as follows: first, the original EEG signal is subjected to a one-dimensional convolution method to achieve a Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and passed through a Mel filter bank to obtain a logarithmic Mel spectrogram, and then the resulting logarithmic Mel spectrogram is fed into a fatigue detection model to complete the fatigue detection task for the EEG signals. The fatigue detection model consists of a 6-layer convolutional neural network (CNN), bi-directional recurrent neural networks (Bi-RNNs), and a classifier. In the modeling phase, spectrogram features are transported to the 6-layer CNN to automatically learn high-level features, thereby extracting temporal features in the bi-directional RNN to obtain spectrogram-temporal information. Finally, the alert or fatigue state is obtained by a classifier consisting of a fully connected layer, a ReLU activation function, and a softmax function. Experiments were conducted on publicly available datasets in this study. The results show that the method can accurately distinguish between alert and fatigue states with high stability.

OBJECTIVE: This qualitative exploratory study subjectively investigates the contextual factors inﬂuencing fatigue among suburban bus drivers.     METHODS: Collecting data was conducted through 14 in-depth interviews with suburban bus drivers working in Tehran province’s transportation system, Iran. The interview recording was transcribed by the research team and entered into the qualitative data analysis software. Two independent coders with qualitative content analysis and thematic analysis approach analyzed transcripts.     RESULTS: Four themes emerged, including human factors (with categories of individual characteristic and lifestyle), vehicle factors (with categories of design and performance), job factors (with categories of task requirement, quantity and quality of sleep, and circadian rhythm,) and environmental factors (with categories of the physical and economic environment). We found a more signiﬁcant number of codes and categories and thus more contextual factors associated with job factors.

This work explores use of a few-shot transfer learning method to train and implement a convolutional spiking neural network (CSNN) on a BrainChip Akida AKD1000 neuromorphic system-on-chip for developing individual-level, instead of traditionally used group-level, models using electroencephalographic data. The efficacy of the method is studied on an advanced driver assist system related task of predicting braking intention. Approach. Data are collected from participants operating an NVIDIA JetBot on a testbed simulating urban streets for three different scenarios. Participants receive a braking indicator in the form of: (1) an audio countdown in a nominal baseline, stress-free environment; (2) an audio countdown in an environment with added elements of physical fatigue and active cognitive distraction; (3) a visual cue given through stoplights in a stress-free environment. These datasets are then used to develop individual-level models from group-level models using a few-shot transfer learning method, which involves: (1) creating a group-level model by training a CNN on group-level data followed by quantization and recouping any performance loss using quantization-aware retraining; (2) converting the CNN to be compatible with Akida AKD1000 processor; and (3) training the final decision layer on individual-level data subsets to create individual-customized models using an online Akida edge-learning algorithm. Main results. Efficacy of the above methodology to develop individual-specific braking intention predictive models by rapidly adapting the group-level model in as few as three training epochs while achieving at least 90% accuracy, true positive rate and true negative rate is presented. Further, results show the energy-efficiency of the neuromorphic hardware through a power reduction of over 97% with only a 1.3 × increase in latency when using the Akida AKD1000 processor for network inference compared to an Intel Xeon central processing unit.

Naturalistic driving data of 10 highway bus drivers in Taiwan from their daily routes were collected for 4 consecutive days. Their driving behaviours and physiological data during a driving task were determined using a navigation mobile application and heart rate watch. Participants’ self-reported data on sleep, driving-related experience, open-source data on weather and the traffic congestion level were obtained. Five machine learning models – logistic regression, random forest, naive Bayes, support vector machine and gated recurrent unit (GRU) – were employed to predict ADBs. Results. Most drivers with ADB had low sleep efficiency ( ≤ 80%), with significantly higher scores in driver behaviour questionnaire subcategories of lapses and errors and in the Karolinska sleepiness scale than those without ADBs. Moreover, HRV parameters were significantly different between baseline and pre-ADB event measurements. GRU had the highest accuracy (81.16–84.22%). Conclusions.

The EEG signal indicator is often referred to as the gold standard for measuring fatigue and drowsiness. However, previous studies focused primarily on the trends of EEG signals under certain conditions but overlooking the development of drowsiness indicators based on EEG signals. Furthermore, existing studies still do not agree on what parameters in the EEG signal indicator are best at detecting drowsiness. Thus, this study aims to design an EEG signal-based drowsiness indicator under simulated driving conditions. Drowsy drivers were monitored through EEG signal indicators and subjective assessments. The methods used in this study include statistical significance tests, logistic regression, and support vector machine. The results showed that sleep deprivation had a significant effect on increasing alpha, beta, and theta waves. In addition, driving duration significantly increased the theta power and all EEG ratios and decreased the beta power in the alert group. The ratio of (θ + α)/β and θ/β in the SD group also showed a considerable increase in the end of driving. Furthermore, sleep status and driving duration both influenced subjective sleepiness. EEG signals combined with sleep status and driving duration factors generated acceptable model accuracies (77.1% and 90.2% in training and testing, respectively), with 90.5% sensitivity and 90% specificity in data test.

However, the few studies that have used single-channel EEG devices to investigate the physiological eﬀects of driver fatigue have had inconsistent results, and the question of whether we can monitor driver fatigue reliably with these EEG devices remains open. Here, we assessed the validity of a single-channel EEG device (TGAM-based chip) to monitor changes in mental state (from alertness to fatigue). Fifteen drivers performed a 2-h simulated driving task while we recorded, simultaneously, their prefrontal brain activity and saccadic velocity. We used saccadic velocity as the reference index of fatigue. We also collected subjective ratings of alertness and fatigue, as well as driving performance. We found that the power spectra of the delta EEG band showed an inverted U-shaped quadratic trend (EEG power spectra increased for the ﬁrst hour and half, and decreased during the last thirty minutes), while the power spectra of the beta band linearly increased as the driving session progressed. Coherently, saccadic velocity linearly decreased and speeding time increased, suggesting a clear eﬀect of fatigue. Subjective data corroborated these conclusions.

However, those fatigue indicators rose many discrepancies among simulator and ﬁeld studies, due to the vague conceptualism of fatigue, per se, which hinders the development of fatigue monitoring devices. Method: This paper aims to give psychological insight of the existing non-invasive measures for driver and pilot fatigue by differentiating sleepiness and mental fatigue. Such a study helps to improve research results for a wide range of researchers whose interests lie in the development of in-vehicle fatigue detection devices. First, the nature of fatigue for drivers/pilots is elucidated regarding fatigue types and fatigue responses, which reshapes our understanding of the fatigue issue in the transport industry. Secondly, the widely used objective neurophysiological methods, including electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), and electrocardiography (ECG), physical movement-based methods, vehicle-based methods, ﬁtness-for-duty test as well as subjective methods (self-rating scales) are introduced. On the one hand, considering the difference between mental fatigue and sleepiness effects, the links between the objective and subjective indicators and fatigue are thoroughly investigated and reviewed. On the other hand, to better determine fatigue occurrence, a new combination of measures is recommended, as a single measure is not sufﬁcient to yield a convincing benchmark of fatigue. Finally, since video-based techniques of measuring eye metrics offer a promising and practical method for monitoring operator fatigue, the relationship between fatigue and these eye metrics, that include blink-based, pupil-based, and saccade-based features, are also discussed. To realize a pragmatic fatigue detector for operators in the future, this paper concludes with a discussion on the future directions in terms of methodology of conducting operator fatigue research and fatigue analysis by using eye-related parameters.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""AJAYI""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population | USER-NOTES: {""AJAYI""=>[""No empirical validation""]}",10.1016/j.jsr.2019.12.015,,,

In contrast to physically intrusive methods based on a biological approach (e.g. electrooculogram), computer vision and machine leaning (ML) were used to create a low-cost realtime system to detect whether a user (operator) is drowsy using a simple web camera. The proposed methodology employs drowsiness rules for blink patterns from neuroscience literature, which allows for automatic alertness supervision of users reducing risks of potential human error and then preventing accidents. Speciﬁcally, a temporal element is introduced by concatenating information from several consecutive video frames coupled with the ability of ML models in identifying different eye behavior.

To detect SEMs, we adopt a bimodal Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to deal with temporal information and multimodal information in physiological signals. To extend the distinguishing information, we define a novel horizontal sum (HSUM) signal, which is sum of signals from two horizontal electrooculogram (EOG) channels. Electroencephalogram (EEG)-related features are extracted from the HSUM signal in contrast to those from the traditional O2 signal. EOG features are extracted from the horizontal EOG (HEOG) signals. The results demonstrate that features from multimodal signals (HSUM and HEOG signals, or O2 and HEOG signals) achieve better classification results than features from the single HEOG signal. And the EEG-related features extracted from self-defined HSUM signals achieve comparable results to those from traditional O2 signals, thus avoiding using extra O2 channel.

Addressing the low detection accuracy of existing vehicle distraction detection algorithms and considering practical application scenarios, this paper proposes an improved vehicle distraction detection algorithm based on YOLOv5. The algorithm integrates Attention-based Intra-scale Feature Interaction (AIFI) into the backbone network, enabling it to focus on enhancing feature interactions within the same scale through the attention mechanism.

Additionally, a Triple Feature Encoding (TFE) module has been added to the neck network. This module utilizes multi-scale features, encoding and fusing them to create a more detailed and comprehensive feature representation, enhancing object detection and localization, and enabling the algorithm to fully understand the image. Finally, the shape-IoU (Intersection over Union) loss function is adopted to replace the original IoU for more precise bounding box regression.

Twenty-one participants drove a car simulator for 110 min under conditions optimized to induce drowsiness. We measured physiological and behavioral indicators such as heart rate and variability, respiration rate, head and eyelid movements (blink duration, frequency and PERCLOS) and recorded driving behavior such as time-to-lanecrossing, speed, steering wheel angle, position on the lane.

A Pythonbased program detects the real-time images of the driver’s face using OpenCV, while deep learning models built on Keras analyze the facial data.

The development of car driver fatigue detectors has employing electroencephalogram (EEG)-based technologies in recent years and made it possible to swiftly and accurately determine the level of a driver’s fatigue. However, individual variability and the sensitivity of EEG signals reduce the detection precision. Recently, another type of video-based technology for detecting driver fatigue by recording changes in the drivers’ eye characteristics has also been explored. In order to improve the classiﬁcation performance of EEG-based approaches, this paper introduces the ADTIDO (Automatic Detect the TIred Deck Ofﬁcers) algorithm, an EEG-based classiﬁcation method of deck ofﬁcers’ fatigue level, which combines a video-based approach to record the ofﬁcer’s eye closure time for each time window. This paper uses a Discrete Wavelet Transformer (DWT) and decomposes the EEG signals into six sub-signals, from which we extract various EEG-based features, e.g., MAV, SD, and RMS. Unlike the traditional video-based method of calculating the Eyelid Closure Degree (ECD), this paper then obtains the ECD values from the EEG signals. The ECD-EEG fusion features are then created and used as the inputs for a classiﬁer by combining the ECD and EEG feature sets. In addition, the present work develops the deﬁnition of “fatigue” at the individual level based on the real-time operational reaction time of the deck ofﬁcer. To verify the efﬁcacy of this research, the authors conducted their trials by using the EEG signals gathered from 21 subjects. It was found that Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) networks outperform other classiﬁers, reaching a classiﬁcation accuracy of 90.19 percent, 1.89 percent greater than that of only using EEG features as inputs.

However, most of the current studies on driver emotions use a single modality, such as EEG, eye trackers, and driving data. In complex situations, a single modality may not be able to fully consider a driver’s complete emotional characteristics and provides poor robustness. In recent years, some studies have used multimodal thinking to monitor single emotions such as driver fatigue and anger, but in actual driving environments, negative emotions such as sadness, anger, fear, and fatigue all have a signiﬁcant impact on driving safety. However, there are very few research cases using multimodal data to accurately predict drivers’ comprehensive emotions. Therefore, based on the multi-modal idea, this paper aims to improve drivers’ comprehensive emotion recognition. By combining the three modalities of a driver’s voice, facial image, and video sequence, the six classification tasks of drivers’ emotions are performed as follows: sadness, anger, fear, fatigue, happiness, and emotional neutrality. In order to accurately identify drivers’ negative emotions to improve driving safety, this paper proposes a multi-modal fusion framework based on the CNN + Bi-LSTM + HAM to identify driver emotions. The framework fuses feature vectors of driver audio, facial expressions, and video sequences for comprehensive driver emotion recognition. Experiments have proved the effectiveness of the multi-modal data proposed in this paper for driver emotion recognition, and its recognition accuracy has reached 85.52%.

Unless drivers have an appropriate mental model for the capabilities and limitations of the automation, they may not activate the automation safely or appropriately on the road, potentially leading to a collision. As such, a training package (L4DTP) was developed to improve drivers’ decisions and behaviour when activating an AV system and this was evaluated in a between-subjects simulator experiment. Drivers received no training (NT, control group), read an owner’s manual (OM, experimental group 1: current training provision) or underwent the L4DTP (experimental group 2: new training programme). All drivers then experienced five scenarios in a driving simulator where they encountered road conditions which were safe and unsafe for activation. Their activation decisions, behaviour, trust in automation, workload and mental models were measured. This experiment found that drivers who read the OM or underwent the L4DTP made better activation decisions and showed better activation behaviour compared to drivers who received NT. Additionally, drivers who underwent the L4DTP found it easier, less demanding and felt under less time pressure when making their decisions, had to expend less effort to reach the same activation performance and had more appropriate and comprehensive mental models for when the automation can be activated compared to drivers who read the OM. This L4DTP can make roads safer by reducing collisions linked to poor activation decisions and behaviour. Therefore, there is the potential for a real benefit for society if this training programme is adopted into mandatory AV driver training.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""AJAYI""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population | USER-NOTES: {""AJAYI""=>[""not driver fatigue""]}",10.1016/j.apergo.2023.104057,,,

Background: High threshold and low threshold motor units contribute differently to force generation capability and fatigue at different rates. However, we know little about how high and low threshold motor units recover following fatiguing contractile activity.     Methods: Fourteen males and fourteen females sustained an isometric elbow extensor contraction until volitional fatigue at high (70 % MVF) and low (20 % MVF) intensities. The ratio of force generated by transcutaneous muscle stimulation of the triceps at 20 Hz and 100 Hz frequencies was measured at baseline and intermittently for 1 h post fatigue to characterize PLFFD.     Results: The 20/100 Hz force ratio was initially (0–4 min) significantly greater (meaning less force depression) following the high intensity protocol. However, the 20/100 Hz ratio for both intensities was similar for the duration of recovery thereafter.     Conclusion: Initial differences in the 20/100 Hz ratio within the first 0–4 min are likely explained by postactivation potentiation following the higher intensity submaximal contraction. However, the similarity in the recovery of 20/100 Hz ratio thereafter supports the hypothesis that once PLFFD is present, the recovery rate may be independent from how fatigue and corresponding PLFFD developed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""AJAYI""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population | USER-NOTES: {""AJAYI""=>[""depression - not fatigue""]}",10.1016/j.apergo.2025.104552,,,

Therefore, this paper utilizes the decision logic process and prior knowledge model of human drivers to form a robot’s decision framework, narrowing the cognitive differences between human and robot. Besides, embedding the human-robot-environment features that affect the decision-making process as prior knowledge into the robot’s decision-making system can effectively reduce perceptual gaps. Under the same decision framework, a negotiation strategy is proposed for forming a unified decision outcome between human and robot by finding an optimal concession rate.

It also leverages virtual reality equipment and visual augmentation technologies to establish a remote human-robot collaborative decision-making experimental system. The experimental results conducted in complex obstacle terrain demonstrate the effectiveness of adopting the negotiation strategy for human-robot collaborative decision-making.

Potholes can cause accidents when drivers lose control after hitting or swerving to avoid them, which may lead to injuries or fatal crashes. Also, potholes may result in property damages, such as flat tires, scrapes, dents, and leaks. Additionally, potholes are costly; for example, in the United States, potholes cost drivers about $3 Billion annually. Traditional ways of attending to potholes involve field surveys carried out by skilled personnel to determine their sizes for quantity and cost estimates. This process is expensive, prone to errors, subjectivity, unsafe, and time-consuming. Some authorities use sensor vehicles to carry out the surveys, a method that is accurate, safer, and faster than the traditional approach but much more expensive; therefore, not all authorities can afford them.

This paper presents a Deep Learning model trained using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm to capture potholes and estimate their dimensions and locations using only built-in vehicle technologies. The model attained 93.0 % precision, 91.6 % recall, 87.0 % F1-score, and 96.3 % mAP. A statistical analysis of the on-site test results indicates that the results are significant at a 5 % level, with a p-value of 0.037. This approach provides an economical and faster way of monitoring road surface conditions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""AJAYI""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population | USER-NOTES: {""AJAYI""=>[""potholes - not driver fatigue""]}",10.1016/j.mlwa.2024.100547,,,

Surface defects on the steel balls will significantly reduce their useful life and cause linear or rotational transmission errors. Human visual inspection of precision steel balls demands significant labor work. Besides, human inspection cannot maintain consistent quality assurance. To address these limitations and reduce inspection time, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based optical inspection system has been developed that automatically detects steel ball defects using a novel designated vertical mechanism. During image detection processing, two key challenges were addressed and resolved. They are the reflection caused by the coaxial light onto the ball center and the image deformation appearing at the edge of the steel balls. The special vertical rotating mechanism utilizing a spinning rod along with a spiral track was developed to enable successful and reliable full steel ball surface inspection during the rod rotation. The combination of the spinning rod and the spiral rotating component effectively rotates the steel ball to facilitate capturing complete surface images. Geometric calculations demonstrate that the steel balls can be completely inspected through specific rotation degrees, with the surface fully captured in 12 photo shots. These images are then analyzed by a CNN to determine surface quality defects. This study presents a new inspection method that enables the entire examination of steel ball surfaces. The successful development of this innovative automated optical inspection system with CNN represents a significant advancement in inspection quality control for precision steel balls.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""AJAYI""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong study design | USER-NOTES: {""AJAYI""=>[""No empirical validation""]}",10.32604/cmc.2025.063441,,,
