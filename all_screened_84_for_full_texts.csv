The enhanced modified Z-score preprocessing method effectively reduces noise and outliers in EEG data, significantly improving the quality of features for fatigue classification. The DBN component is used for unsupervised feature extraction, while the LSTM component captures temporal dependencies in the data, enhancing the accuracy of the model. Experimental results showed that the proposed model achieved an overall accuracy of 82.41%, a specificity of 65.10%, and an F1score of 84.90%, indicating robust performance in classifying different driver fatigue states.

This paper, which is focused on image processing technology and research on driver fatigue, proposes a driver fatigue detection model based on image processing, and introduces various methods of identifying driver fatigue. It also discusses various algorithms, such as the Hough transform, AdaBoost, and PERCLOS algorithms, which can recognize a driver’s eyes and skin color. The experimental section of this paper explains the proposed driver fatigue detection model in many aspects. The analysis section analyzes eye closure detection, PERCLOS detection, and detection rate with regard to different algorithms used to detect driver behavior, the influence of spectacles on detection, and the success rate of different algorithms under different degrees of illumination. The PERCLOS value of the tester obtained in the “awakened” state is significantly smaller than the PERCLOS value obtained in the “fatigued” state. For example, the value of Tester 1 in time period 1 is 0.173 when awake, and the value in the same time period when fatigued is 0.523. The change in the percentage of eye closure is closely related to the degree of fatigue of the human body, and usually shows a positive correlation. Comprehensive analysis shows that the proposed image processing technology can effectively realize facial recognition. Therefore, the state of the driver’s eyes, limbs and other parts can be recognized by this technology, and the driver’s state of fatigue can be accurately assessed."	4/15/2022	5/20/2025 12:39	5/24/2025 12:20	5/20/2025 12:39	204-219		0	12										en					DOI.org (CSL JSON)				C:\Users\LATITUDE E7470\Zotero\storage\S6J5V4TT\Mu et al. - 2022 - Research on a Driver Fatigue Detection Model Based on Image Processing.pdf		INCLUDED

As a result, identifying the driver’s drowsiness before their capacity to drive is jeopardized. An automated hybrid drowsiness classification method that incorporates the artificial neural network (ANN) and the gray wolf optimizer (GWO) is presented to discriminate human drowsiness and fatigue for this aim. The proposed method is evaluated in alert and sleep-deprived settings on the driver drowsiness detection of video dataset from the National Tsing Hua University Computer Vision Lab. The video was subjected to various video and image processing techniques to detect the drivers’ eye condition. Four features of the eye were extracted to determine the condition of drowsiness, the percentage of eyelid closure (PERCLOS), blink frequency, maximum closure duration of the eyes, and eye aspect ratio (ARE). These parameters were then integrated into an ANN and combined with the proposed method (gray wolf optimizer with ANN [GWOANN]) for drowsiness classification. The accuracy of these models was calculated, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method is the best. An Adadelta optimizer with 3 and 4 hidden layer networks of (13, 9, 7, and 5) and (200, 150, 100, 50, and 25) neurons was utilized.

It is a necessary system for detecting and alerting drivers to their tiredness, which might impair their driving ability and lead to accidents. The project aims to create a reliable and efficient system capable of real-time detection of drowsiness using OpenCV, Dlib, and facial landmark detection technologies. The project's results show that the sleepiness detection method can accurately and precisely identify tiredness in real time. The technology is less intrusive and more economical than conventional sleepiness detection techniques. The system is based on a 68 facial landmark detector, which is a highly trained and effective detector capable of recognizing human face points. The detector aids in assessing whether the driver's eyes are closed or open. The system analyses the data collected by the detector using machine learning methods to discover patterns associated with drowsiness. When drowsiness is detected, the system incorporates a warning mechanism, such as an alarm or a vibration in the steering wheel, to notify the driver. A variety of studies with different drivers and driving conditions were used to evaluate the performance of the real-time driver drowsiness detection system. The results show that the technology can detect tiredness properly and deliver timely warnings to the driver.

Despite considerable research in this area, this paper aims to improve the precision of drowsiness detection specifically for long-haul travel by employing the Dlib-based facial feature detection algorithm. This study proposes two algorithms: a static and adaptive frame threshold. Both approaches utilize eye closure ratio (ECR) and mouth aperture ratio (MAR) parameters to determine the driver’s level of drowsiness. The static threshold method issues a warning when the ECR and/or MAR values reach specific thresholds. In this method, the ECR threshold is established at 0.15 and the MAR threshold at 0.4. The static threshold method demonstrated an accuracy of 89.4% and a sensitivity of 96.5% using 1000 images. The adaptive frame threshold algorithm uses a counter to monitor the number of consecutive frames that meet the drowsiness criteria before triggering a warning. Additionally, the number of consecutive frames required is adjusted dynamically over time to enhance detection accuracy and more accurately indicate a state of drowsiness.

Road crashes are fast rising across the globe and have drawn many road safety commissions and concerned individuals to discuss ways to reduce this menacing situation drastically. With the introduction of artificial intelligence and technological advancement, the government and state commissions have beckoned on the various universities and research institutions to develop methods to curb the rise of automobile crashes. Some causes of these crashes include drunk driving and drowsiness, the latter is most prevalent as it occurs to all and sundry. Drowsiness detection can be categorized into three main techniques; behavioral-based, vehicular-based, and physiological-based. In this research, the behavioral-based approach was studied, with significant consideration being the cost of implementation, execution time, and accuracy. This research investigates drowsiness detection using a novel approach that directly utilizes image pixels from facial geometry to enhance accuracy in classification. Unlike prior studies that relied solely on recorded EAR and MOR values from images, our methodology harnesses direct input from facial features, yielding promising results in drowsiness classification.

Detection of driver drowsiness (DDD) or fatigue is an important and challenging task to save road-side accidents. To help reduce the mortality rate, the “HybridFatigue” DDD system was proposed. This HybridFatigue system is based on integrating visual features through PERCLOS measure and non-visual features by heart-beat (ECG) sensors. A hybrid system was implemented to combine both visual and non-visual features. Those hybrid features have been extracted and classified as driver fatigue by advanced deep-learning-based architectures in real-time. A multi-layer based transfer learning approach by using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and deep-belief network (DBN) was used to detect driver fatigue from hybrid features. To solve night-time driving and to get accurate results, the ECG sensors were utilized on steering by analyzing heartbeat signals in case if the camera is not enough to get facial features. Also to solve the accurate detection of center head-position of drivers, two-cameras were mounted instead of a single camera. As a result, a new HybridFatigue system was proposed to get high accuracy of driver's fatigue. To train and test this HybridFatigue system, three online datasets were used. Compare to state-of-the-art DDD system, the HybridFatigue system is outperformed. On average, the HybridFatigue system achieved 94.5% detection accuracy on 4250 images when tested on different subjects in the variable environment. The experimental results indicate that the HybridFatigue system can be utilized to decrease accidents."	2020	5/20/2025 12:42	5/24/2025 12:33	5/20/2025 12:42			1	11		IJACSA	HybridFatigue							en					DOI.org (Crossref)				C:\Users\LATITUDE E7470\Zotero\storage\BCCHBR8J\Abbas - 2020 - HybridFatigue A Real-time Driver Drowsiness Detection using Hybrid Features and Transfer Learning.pdf		INCLUDED

Hence it is crucial to develop an automatic driver warning system that can send timely warning signals to the drivers. This issue involves determining the driver’s mental state that is ultimately based on the driver’s facial expressions. Automated facial emotion recognition is a recent development in the image processing domain and is the need of the hour in applications like driver warning systems. The existing methods are capable of recognizing facial emotions even when provided with a noisy signal or imperfect data, but ultimately it lacks accuracy. It is also ineffective in dealing with spontaneous emotions, and recognition. The proposed approach develops a driver warning system that extracts the facial expressions based on a novel efficient Local Octal Pattern (LOP) and effectively recognizes the facial expressions based on Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The LOP feature map serves as an input to CNN and guides in the selection of CNN learning data thereby improving and further enhancing the understanding and learning of CNN. It also has an ability to recognize both natural and spontaneous emotions, as well as image and video can be considered as an input.The experimental results consideringYawDD dataset indicates that the proposed system has been efficiently evaluated by considering the with metrics such as Precision, Recall and F-Score and thereby it is observed and inferred that the proposed system obtained a high recall rate of 96.09% in comparison with the other state-of-the-art methods."	9/30/2019	5/20/2025 12:42	5/24/2025 12:27	5/20/2025 12:42	831-838		3	8		IJRTE								en					DOI.org (Crossref)				C:\Users\LATITUDE E7470\Zotero\storage\LRMXXU9B\Intelligent_Driver_Warning_System_using.pdf		INCLUDED

However, existing research on feature generation has overlooked the effective and automated aspects of this process. The challenge of extracting features from unpredictable and complex EEG signals has led to the frequent use of deep learning models for signal classification. Unfortunately, these models often neglect generalizability to novel subjects. To address these concerns, this study proposes the utilization of a modified deep convolutional neural network, specifically the Inception?dilated ResNet architecture. Trained on spectrograms derived from segmented EEG data, the network undergoes analysis in both temporal and spatial?frequency dimensions. The primary focus is on accurately detecting and classifying fatigue. The inherent variability of EEG signals between individuals, coupled with limited samples during fatigue states, presents challenges in fatigue detection through brain signals.

With the enhancements of computer vision and deep learning (DL), driver drowsiness detection systems have been developed previously, in an attempt to improve road safety. These systems experienced performance degradation under real-world testing due to factors such as driver movement and poor lighting. This study proposed to improve the training of DL models for driver drowsiness detection by applying data augmentation (DA) techniques that model these real-world scenarios. This paper studies six DL models for driver drowsiness detection: four configurations of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), two custom configurations as well as the architectures designed by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) (i.e. VGG16 and VGG19); a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). These DL models were trained using two datasets of eye images, where the state of eye (open or closed) is used in determining driver drowsiness. The performance of the DL models was measured with respect to accuracy, F1-Score, precision, negative class precision, recall and specificity. When comparing the performance of DL models trained on datasets with and without DA in aggregation, it was found that all metrics were improved. After removing outliers from the results, it was found that the average improvement in both accuracy and F1 score due to DA was +4.3%. Furthermore, it is shown that the extent to which the DA techniques improve DL model performance is correlated with the inherent model performance. For DL models with accuracy and F1-Score ? 90%, results show that the DA techniques studied should improve performance by at least +5%."	2023	5/20/2025 12:42	5/24/2025 12:20	5/20/2025 12:42			1	14		IJACSA								en					DOI.org (Crossref)				C:\Users\LATITUDE E7470\Zotero\storage\4C6CERN8\Mohamed et al. - 2023 - Data Augmentation for Deep Learning Algorithms that Perform Driver Drowsiness Detection.pdf		INCLUDED

However, due to the significant differences in EEG signals between participants, the prevalence of redundant information in multichannel EEG data, and the computational burden in combining channel selection with neural networks, achieving an accurate and efficient real-time driver drowsiness recognition remains challenging. To overcome these limitations, this article proposes a novel deep learning framework that utilizes a separable convolutional neural network (CNN) to mine the intricate spatiotemporal information in EEG signals, combined with the channel selection layer to jointly optimize EEG channels and network parameters. This layer employs an efficient embedded Gumbel-Softmax technique for discrete sampling and differentiable approximation. To prevent the introduction of duplicate channels, we impose penalties on the row sums of the selection matrix to encourage the selection neurons to learn distinct channels, enabling the neural network to train in an end-to-end manner.

Furthermore, the problem of incorrect detection due to facial expression is still not well addressed. In this article, a model based on BP neural network and time cumulative effect was proposed to solve these problems. Experimental data were used to carry out this work and validate the proposed method. Firstly, the Adaboost algorithm was applied to detect faces, and the Kalman ?lter algorithm was used to trace the face movement. Then, a cascade regression tree-based method was used to detect the 68 facial landmarks and an improved method combining key points and image processing was adopted to calculate the eye aspect ratio (EAR). After that, a BP neural network model was developed and trained by selecting three characteristics: the longest period of continuous eye closure, number of yawns, and percentage of eye closure time (PERCLOS), and then the detection results without and with facial expressions were discussed and analyzed. Finally, by introducing the Sigmoid function, a fatigue detection model considering the time accumulation effect was established, and the drivers’ fatigue state was identi?ed segment by segment through the recorded video. Compared with the traditional BP neural network model, the detection accuracies of the proposed model without and with facial expressions increased by 3.3% and 8.4%, respectively. The number of incorrect detections in the awake state also decreased obviously.

This study proposes a multistage system utilizing machine and deep learning techniques. The ?rst stage is designed to detect asymmetric states, including tiredness and non-vigilance as well as yawning. The second stage is focused on detecting eye closure. The machine learning approach employs several algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF). Meanwhile, the deep learning approach utilizes 2D and 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

A dataset of HRV features is collected from a driving simulation experiment involving 18 participants. Four machine learning classifiers are evaluated, and a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) is selected for its superior performance, achieving up to 94.35% accuracy. The optimized classifier is successfully deployed on an embedded system, providing a cost-effective and portable solution for the early detection of driver fatigue.

Wearable sensors and camera-based systems are generally employed in the driver drowsiness detection. Electroencephalogram (or EEG) is considered another effective option for the driver drowsiness detection. Various EEG-based drowsiness detection systems have been proposed to date. In this paper, EEG signals are also used for the detection of drowsiness, with the proposed method being composed of three main building blocks. Both raw EEG signals and their corresponding spectrograms are used in the proposed building blocks. In the ?rst building block, while energy distribution and zero-crossing distribution features are calculated from the raw EEG signals, spectral entropy and instantaneous frequency features are extracted from the EEG spectrogram images. In the second building block, deep feature extraction is employed directly on the EEG spectrogram images using pre-trained AlexNet and VGGNet. In the third building block, the tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) is used to decompose the EEG signals into related sub-bands. The spectrogram images of the obtained sub-bands and statistical features, such as mean and standard deviation of the sub-bands’ instantaneous frequencies, are then calculated. Each feature group from each building block is fed to a long-short term memory (LSTM) network for the purposes of classi?cation. The obtained results from the LSTM networks are then fused with a majority voting layer. The MIT-BIH Polysomnographic database was used in the experimental works. The evaluation of the proposed method was carried out with ten-fold cross validation test and the average accuracy represented accordingly. The obtained average accuracy score was 94.31%. The obtained result was also compared with other results to be found in the literature.

Different threshold values can be set for the two kinds of drivers individually. The entropy-based features, namely, the wavelet entropy (WE), the peak-to-peak value of ApEn (PP-ApEn), and the peak-to-peak value of sample entropy (PP-SampEn), were extracted from the collected signals to estimate the driving fatigue stages. We proposed WE in a sliding window (WES), PP-ApEn in a sliding window (PP-ApEnS), and PP-SampEn in a sliding window (PP-SampEnS) for real-time analysis of driver fatigue. The real-time features obtained by WE, PP-ApEn, and PP-SampEn with sliding window were applied to arti?cial neural network for training and testing the system, which gives four situations for the fatigue level of the subjects, namely, normal state, mild fatigue, mood swing, and excessive fatigue.

In particular, the advancement of Artificial Intelligence based neuroadaptive systems is imperative to effectively mitigate this risk. Towards reaching this goal, the present research focuses on investigating the efficacy of physiological indicators, including heart rate variability (HRV), percentage of eyelid closure over the pupil over time (PERCLOS), blink rate, blink percentage, and electrodermal activity (EDA) signals, in predicting driver drowsiness. The study was conducted with a cohort of 30 participants in controlled simulated driving scenarios, with half driving in a non-monotonous environment and the other half in a monotonous environment. Three deep learning algorithms were employed: sequential neural network (SNN) for HRV, 1D-convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) for EDA, and convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) for eye tracking. The HRV-Based Model and EDA-Based Model exhibited strong performance in drowsiness classification, with the HRV model achieving precision, recall, and F1-score of 98.28%, 98%, and 98%, respectively, and the EDA model achieving 96.32%, 96%, and 96% for the same metrics. The confusion matrix further illustrates the model’s performance and highlights high accuracy in both HRV and EDA models, affirming their efficiency in detecting driver drowsiness. However, the Eye-Based Model faced difficulties in identifying drowsiness instances, potentially attributable to dataset imbalances and underrepresentation of specific fatigue states. Despite the challenges, this work significantly contributes to ongoing efforts to improve road safety by laying the foundation for effective real-time neuroadaptive systems for drowsiness detection and mitigation."	2024	5/20/2025 12:49	5/24/2025 12:32	5/20/2025 12:49	93075-93086			12		IEEE Access								en	https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/				DOI.org (Crossref)				C:\Users\LATITUDE E7470\Zotero\storage\N5GWRYHJ\Alguindigue et al. - 2024 - Biosignals Monitoring for Driver Drowsiness Detection Using Deep Neural Networks.pdf		INCLUDED

Advanced driver assistance systems that could detect mental states which are associated with hazardous situations, such as drowsiness, are of critical importance. EEG signals are used widely for brain-computer interfaces, as well as mental state recognition. However, these systems are still dif?cult to design due to very low signal-to-noise ratios and cross-subject disparities, requiring individual calibration cycles.

It uses computer vision and pattern recognition techniques on the iPhone to assess whether the driver is drowsy or distracted using the rear-camera, the microphone, the inertial sensors and the GPS. We present the general architecture of DriveSafe and evaluate its performance using data from 12 drivers in two different studies. The first one evaluates the detection of some inattentive driving behaviors obtaining an overall precision of 82% at 92% of recall. The second one compares the scores between DriveSafe vs the commercial AXA Drive app obtaining a better valuation to its operation. DriveSafe is the first app for smartphones based on inbuilt sensors able to detect inattentive behaviors evaluating the quality of the driving at the same time. It represents a new disruptive technology because, on the one hand, it provides similar ADAS features that found in luxury cars, and on the other hand, it presents a viable alternative for the “blackboxes” installed in vehicles by the insurance companies."	2014-06	5/20/2025 12:51	5/24/2025 12:30	5/20/2025 12:51	240-245						DriveSafe					IEEE	"MI, USA"	en					DOI.org (Crossref)				C:\Users\LATITUDE E7470\Zotero\storage\BNEGRYL2\Bergasa et al. - 2014 - DriveSafe An app for alerting inattentive drivers and scoring driving behaviors.pdf		INCLUDED																																2014 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)

Recent statistics show that drowsy drivers cause an estimated 15.5% of fatal accidents. With the widespread use of mobile devices and roadside units, these accidents can be significantly prevented using a drowsiness detection solution. While several solutions were proposed in the literature, they all fall short of presenting a distributed architecture that can answer the needs of these applications without breaching the driver’s privacy. This paper proposes a two-stage Driver Drowsiness Detection System using smart edge computing. Mobile devices in the car are used to capture and analyze the current condition of the drivers without sharing their data. The smart edge is deployed as a decision-maker where the drowsiness is confirmed when the information about the driver status received from the mobile client and the observed car path match. Our approach relies on a) a distributed edge architecture that has two levels of hierarchy, namely the Main Edge Node (MEN) and Local Edge Node (LEN), to better manage the area of interest and b) a data fusion offloading strategy that considers: 1) local detection of driver drowsiness through facial expressions using CNN model, 2) global detection of car path through acceleration readings using YoLov5 algorithm, and finally, 3) a two-layer LSTM algorithm for drowsiness detection based on the local and the global detection.

Collected EEG signals were ?rst decomposed into delta-range, theta-range, alpha-range and beta-range by wavelet packet transform (WPT). Unlike other approaches, a multi-channel network construction method based on Phase Lag Index (PLI) was then proposed in this paper. Finally, the functional connectivity between alert state (at the beginning of the drive) and fatigue state (at the end of the drive) in multiple frequency bands were analyzed. The results indicate that functional connectivity of the brain area was signi?cantly di?erent between alert and fatigue states, especially in alpha-range and beta-range. Particularly, the frontal-to-parietal functional connectivity was weakened. Meanwhile, lower clustering coe?cient (C) values and higher characteristic path length (L) values were observed in fatigue state in comparison with alert state. Based on this, two new EEG feature selection approaches, C and L in the corresponding sub-frequency range were applied to feature recognition and classi?cation system.

Firstly, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of 12 subjects in the real driving environment are collected and categorized into two states: fatigue and awake. Secondly, the WSN algorithm extracts wavelet scattering coefficients of EEG signals, and these coefficients are used as input in support vector machine (SVM) as feature vectors for classification. Results: The results showed that the average classification accuracy of 12 subjects reached 99.33%; the average precision rate reached 99.28%; the average recall rate reached 98.27%; the average F1 score reached 98.74%; and the average classification accuracy of the public data set SEED-VIG reached 99.39%.

However, many existing methods involves tedious manual parameter tunings, a process that is both time-consuming and results in task-specific models. On the other hand, most of the researches on fatigue recognition are based on class-balanced and sufficient data, and effectively “mine” meaningful information from class-imbalanced and insufficient data for fatigue recognition is still a challenge. In this paper, we proposed two novel models, the attention-based residual adaptive multiscale fully convolutional network-long short term memory network (ARMFCN-LSTM), and the Generative ARMFCN-LSTM (GARMFCN-LSTM) aiming to address this issue. ARMFCN-LSTM excels at automatically extracting multiscale representations through adaptive multiscale temporal convolutions, while capturing temporal dependency features through LSTM. GARMFCN-LSTM integrates Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) into ARMFCN-LSTM to improve driver fatigue detection performance by alleviating data scarcity and addressing class imbalances. Experimental results show that ARMFCN-LSTM achieves the highest classification accuracy of 95.84% in driver fatigue detection on the class-balanced EEG dataset (binary classification), and GARMFCNLSTM attained an improved classification accuracy of 84.70% on the class-imbalanced EOG dataset (triple classification), surpassing the competing methods.

The challenge of driver fatigue detection involves balancing the efficiency and accuracy of the detection process. While various detection methods are available, electroencephalography (EEG) is considered the gold standard due to its high precision in terms of detecting fatigue. However, deep learning models for EEG-based fatigue detection are limited by their large numbers of parameters and low computational efficiency levels, making it difficult to implement them on mobile devices. Methods: To overcome this challenge, an attention-based Ghost-LSTM neural network (AGL-Net) is proposed for EEG-based fatigue detection in this paper. AGL-Net utilizes an attention mechanism to focus on relevant features and incorporates Ghost bottlenecks to efficiently extract spatial EEG fatigue information. Temporal EEG fatigue features are extracted using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. We establish two types of models: regression and classification models. In the regression model, we use linear regression to obtain regression values. In the classification model, we classify features based on the predicted values obtained from regression. Results: AGL-Net exhibits improved computational efficiency and a more lightweight design than existing deep learning models, as evidenced by its floating-point operations per second (FLOPs) and Params values of 2.67 M and 103,530, respectively. Furthermore, AGL-Net achieves an average accuracy of approximately 87.3% and an average root mean square error (RMSE) of approximately 0.0864 with the Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) Emotion EEG Dataset (SEED)-VIG fatigued driving dataset, indicating its advanced performance capabilities. Conclusions: The experiments conducted with the SEED-VIG dataset demonstrate the feasibility and advanced performance of the proposed fatigue detection method. The effectiveness of each AGL-Net module is verified through thorough ablation experiments. Additionally, the implementation of the Ghost bottleneck module greatly enhances the computational efficiency of the model. Overall, the proposed method has higher accuracy and computational efficiency than prior fatigue detection methods, demonstrating its considerable practical application value."	10/23/2023	5/20/2025 12:56	5/24/2025 12:26	5/20/2025 12:56	146		6	22		J.

All feature sets were used as the input of a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), a fast and highly accurate boosting ensemble method. The output of GBDT determined whether a driver was in a fatigue state or not based on their EEG signals.

Automated driver fatigue detection utilizing EEG decreases the incidence probability of related traf?c accidents. Therefore, devising an appropriate feature extraction technique and selecting a competent classi?cation method can be considered as the crucial part of the effective driver fatigue detection. Therefore, in this study, an EEG-based intelligent system was devised for driver fatigue detection. The proposed framework includes a new feature generation network, which is implemented by using texture descriptors, for fatigue detection. The proposed scheme contains pre-processing, feature generation, informative features selection and classi?cation with shallow classi?ers phases. In the pre-processing, discrete cosine transform and fast Fourier transform are used together. Moreover, dynamic center based binary pattern and multi threshold ternary pattern are utilized together to create a new feature generation network.

Electroencephalography (EEG) has been considered as one of the best physiological signals to detect drivers’ drowsy states, since it directly measures neurophysiological activities in the brain. However, designing a calibration-free system for driver drowsiness detection with EEG is still a challenging task, as EEG suffers from serious mental and physical drifts across different subjects. In this paper, we propose a compact and interpretable Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to discover shared EEG features across different subjects for driver drowsiness detection. We incorporate the Global Average Pooling (GAP) layer in the model structure, allowing the Class Activation Map (CAM) method to be used for localizing regions of the input signal that contribute most for classification. Results show that the proposed model can achieve an average accuracy of 73.22% on 11 subjects for 2-class cross-subject EEG signal classification, which is higher than conventional machine learning methods and other state-of-art deep learning methods. It is revealed by the visualization technique that the model has learned biologically explainable features, e.g., Alpha spindles and Theta burst, as evidence for the drowsy state. It is also interesting to see that the model uses artifacts that usually dominate the wakeful EEG, e.g., muscle artifacts and sensor drifts, to recognize the alert state. The proposed model illustrates a potential direction to use CNN models as a powerful tool to discover shared features related to different mental states across different subjects from EEG signals."	2022-06	5/20/2025 12:57	5/24/2025 12:28	5/20/2025 12:57	173-184			202		Methods								en					DOI.org (Crossref)				C:\Users\LATITUDE E7470\Zotero\storage\U9QXVWF2\Cui et al. - 2022 - A compact and interpretable convolutional neural network for cross-subject driver drowsiness detecti.pdf		INCLUDED

Cardiac monitoring and heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is a candidate method for early and accurate detection of driver sleepiness. This study has 2 objectives: to evaluate the (1) suitability of different preprocessing strategies for detecting and removing outlier heartbeats and spectral transformation of HRV signals and their impact of driver sleepiness assessment and (2) relation between common HRV indices and subjective sleepiness reported by a large number of drivers in real driving situations, for the first time. Methods: The study analyzed >3,500 5-min driving epochs from 76 drivers on a public motorway in Sweden. The electrocardiograph (ECG) data were recorded in 3 studies designed to evaluate the physiological differences between awake and sleepy drivers. The drivers reported their perceived level of sleepiness according to the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) every 5 min. Two standard methods were used for identifying outlier heartbeats: (1) percentage change (PC), where outliers were defined as interbeat intervals deviating >30% from the mean of the four previous intervals and (2) standard deviation (SD), where outliers were defined as interbeat interval deviating >4 SD from the mean interval duration in the current epoch. Three standard methods were used for spectral transformation, which is needed for deriving HRV indices in the frequency domain: (1) Fourier transform; (2) autoregressive model; and (3) Lomb-Scargle periodogram. Different preprocessing strategies were compared regarding their impact on derivation of common HRV indices and their relation to KSS data distribution, using box plots and statistical tests such as analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student’s t test. Results: The ability of HRV indices to discriminate between alert and sleepy drivers does not differ significantly depending on which outlier detection and spectral transformation methods are used. As expected, with increasing sleepiness, the heart rate decreased, whereas heart rate variability overall increased. Furthermore, HRV parameters representing the parasympathetic branch of the autonomous nervous system increased. An unexpected finding was that parameters representing the sympathetic branch of the autonomous nervous system also increased with increasing KSS level. We hypothesize that this increment was due to stress induced by trying to avoid an incident, because the drivers were in real driving situations. Conclusions: The association of HRV indices to KSS did not depend on the preprocessing strategy. No preprocessing method showed superiority for HRV association to driver sleepiness. This was also true for combinations of methods for frequency domain HRV indices. The results prove clear relationships between HRV indices and perceived sleepiness. Thus, HRV analysis shows promise for driver sleepiness detection."	3/18/2019	5/20/2025 12:57	5/24/2025 12:29	5/20/2025 12:57	249-254		3	20		Traffic Injury Prevention								en					DOI.org (Crossref)				C:\Users\LATITUDE E7470\Zotero\storage\NHX8TBUE\Buendia et al. - 2019 - Deriving heart rate variability indices from cardiac monitoring—An indicator of driver sleepiness.pdf		INCLUDED

This paper proposes a novel model for driver sleepiness detection based on electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals. Our model aims to track the change in alpha waves and differentiate the two alpha-related phenomena. Continuous wavelet transform is adopted to extract features from physiological signals in both time and frequency domains.

To deal with insu?cient physiological sample problem, generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to augment the training dataset.

EEG is becoming increasingly useful in the measuring fatigue state. Manual interpretation of EEG signals is impossible, so an effective method for automatic detection of EEG signals is crucial needed. Method: In order to evaluate the complex, unstable, and non-linear characteristics of EEG signals, four feature sets were computed from EEG signals, in which fuzzy entropy (FE), sample entropy (SE), approximate Entropy (AE), spectral entropy (PE), and combined entropies (FE + SE + AE + PE) were included. All these feature sets were used as the input vectors of AdaBoost classi?er, a boosting method which is fast and highly accurate. To assess our method, several experiments including parameter setting and classi?er comparison were conducted on 28 subjects. For comparison, Decision Trees (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) classi?ers are used. Results: The proposed method (combination of FE and AdaBoost) yields superior performance than other schemes. Using FE feature extractor, AdaBoost achieves improved area (AUC) under the receiver operating curve of 0.994, error rate (ERR) of 0.024, Precision of 0.969, Recall of 0.984, F1 score of 0.976, and Matthews correlation coef?cient (MCC) of 0.952, compared to SVM (ERR at 0.035, Precision of 0.957, Recall of 0.974, F1 score of 0.966, and MCC of 0.930 with AUC of 0.990), DT (ERR at 0.142, Precision of 0.857, Recall of 0.859, F1 score of 0.966, and MCC of 0.716 with AUC of 0.916) and NB (ERR at 0.405, Precision of 0.646, Recall of 0.434, F1 score of 0.519, and MCC of 0.203 with AUC of 0.606). It shows that the FE feature set and combined feature set outperform other feature sets. AdaBoost seems to have better robustness against changes of ratio of test samples for all samples and number of subjects, which might therefore aid in the real-time detection of driver fatigue through the classi?cation of EEG signals.

Sex-independent and sex-specific differences in HRV features between alert and fatigued states derived from 2 min electrocardiogram (ECG) signals were determined. Then, decision trees were used for driver fatigue detection using the HRV features of either all subjects or those of only males or females. Nineteen, eighteen, and thirteen HRV features were significantly different (Mann–Whitney U test, p < 0.01) between the two mental states for all subjects, males, and females, respectively.

The system relies on multiple visual cues to characterize the level of alertness of the driver. The parameters used for detecting fatigue are: eye closure duration measured through eye state information and yawning analyzed through mouth state information. Initially, the face is located through Viola–Jones face detection method to ensure the presence of driver in video frame. Then, a mouth window is extracted from the face region, in which lips are searched through spatial fuzzy c-means (s-FCM) clustering. Simultaneously, the pupils are also detected in the upper part of the face window on the basis of radii, inter-pupil distance and angle. The monitored information of eyes and mouth are further passed to Fuzzy Expert System (FES) that classi?es the true state of the driver. The system has been tested using real data, with different sequences recorded in day and night driving conditions, and with users belonging to different race and gender.

Through visual observation and statistical analysis we find that SEMs occur during eye-closed periods and have a high overall coverage rate during driving, which makes it feasible to utilize detecting SEMs to recognize drivers’ sleep onset period. To detect SEMs, we adopt a bimodal Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to deal with temporal information and multimodal information in physiological signals. To extend the distinguishing information, we define a novel horizontal sum (HSUM) signal, which is sum of signals from two horizontal electrooculogram (EOG) channels. Electroencephalogram (EEG)-related features are extracted from the HSUM signal in contrast to those from the traditional O2 signal. EOG features are extracted from the horizontal EOG (HEOG) signals. The results demonstrate that features from multimodal signals (HSUM and HEOG signals, or O2 and HEOG signals) achieve better classification results than features from the single HEOG signal. And the EEG-related features extracted from self-defined HSUM signals achieve comparable results to those from traditional O2 signals, thus avoiding using extra O2 channel. The proposed method of detecting SEMs using the bimodal LSTM to classify features from HSUM and HEOG signals achieves the average F-score of 76.5%, which is higher than the classic support vector machine by 7.5%. This method of detecting SEMs using only two channels helps to build a user acceptable and feasible system for recognizing drivers’ sleep onset period."	2022-05	5/20/2025 13:05	5/24/2025 12:23	5/20/2025 13:05	103608			75		Biomedical Signal Processing and Control								en					DOI.org (Crossref)				C:\Users\LATITUDE E7470\Zotero\storage\FBNLM4TR\Jiao and Jiang - 2022 - Detecting slow eye movements with bimodal-LSTM for recognizing drivers’ sleep onset period.pdf		INCLUDED

Researchers are in full swing to develop various algorithms for driver stress recognition (DSR) to enable smart transportation. Existing methods have encountered various difficulties. To relieve the problems and improve the accuracy, a DSR algorithm has been developed using multiobjective genetic algorithm based fuzzy c-means clustering (MOGAFCM). This algorithm adopts Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal as input which is further used to compute features. Analysis has been carried out to investigate feature selection. Attention is drawn to the reduction of time and model complexity of MOGA-FCM. To reduce the time complexity, hyper-grid scheme is introduced, and the storage of membership matrix is eliminated. To reduce the model complexity, one of the objectives of the multiobjective optimization problem is to minimize the number of clusters. Results indicate that the time complexity and model complexity have been reduced by 68 %, and a reduction of two clusters, respectively. MOGA-FCM achieves equivalent true negative rate (TNReq) and equivalent true positive rate (TPReq) of 89.9 % and 91.7 % respectively. It improves the average true negative rate by 9.8–25.3 % and average true positive rate by 9.5–26.6 % compared to traditional clustering methods. Compared to existing biometric signal-based, speechbased and image-based approaches, it improves the performance by at least 7.02 % and 12.9 % in TNReq and TPReq respectively. As a result, the proposed algorithm can give an accurate and immediate reminding to drivers to take a rest or calm down in order to prevent traffic accident and lower the risk of developing stress-related disease."	2022-09	5/20/2025 13:05	5/24/2025 12:28	5/20/2025 13:05	100668			35		Sustainable Computing: Informatics and Systems	Driver stress recognition for smart transportation							en					DOI.org (Crossref)				C:\Users\LATITUDE E7470\Zotero\storage\EDQXBFBL\Chui - 2022 - Driver stress recognition for smart transportation Applying multiobjective genetic algorithm for im.pdf		INCLUDED

For the accidents occurring on the road, one of the primary reasons is driver fatigueness and it can be easily identified by the EEG. In this work, five efficient and robust approaches for the EEG-based driving fatigue detection and classification are proposed. In the first proposed strategy, the concept of Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are merged and then the Fuzzy C Means based Support Vector Regression (FCM-SVR) classification module is utilized to get the output. In the second proposed strategy, the Marginal Fisher Analysis (MFA) is implemented and the concepts of conditional feature mapping and cross domain transfer learning are implemented and classified with machine learning classifiers. In the third proposed strategy, the concepts of Flexible Analytic Wavelet Transform (FAWT) and Tunable Q Wavelet Transform (TQWT) are implemented and merged and then it is classified with Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Kernel ELM and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) classifiers. In the fourth proposed strategy, the concepts of Correntropy spectral density and Lyapunov exponent with Rosenstein algorithm is implemented and then the multi distance signal level difference is computed followed by the calculation of the Geodesic minimum distance to the Riemannian means and finally tangent space mapping is implemented to it before feeding it to classification. In the fifth or final proposed strategy, the Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT) is implemented and then the Hilbert marginal spectrum is computed. Then using the Blackhole optimization algorithm, the features are selected and finally it is classified with Cascade Adaboost classifier.

To prevent accidents, several low-cost hypovigilance (hypo-V) systems were developed in the past based on a multimodal-hybrid (physiological and behavioral) feature set. Similarly in this paper, real-time driver inattention and fatigue (Hypo-Driver) detection system is proposed through multi-view cameras and biosignal sensors to extract hybrid features. The considered features are derived from non-intrusive sensors that are related to the changes in driving behavior and visual facial expressions. To get enhanced visual facial features in uncontrolled environment, three cameras are deployed on multiview points (0?, 45?, and 90?) of the drivers. To develop a Hypo-Driver system, the physiological signals (electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), electro-myography (sEMG), and electrooculography (EOG)) and behavioral information (PERCLOS70-80-90%, mouth aspect ratio (MAR), eye aspect ratio (EAR), blinking frequency (BF), head-titled ratio (HT-R)) are collected and pre-processed, then followed by feature selection and fusion techniques. The driver behaviors are classified into five stages such as normal, fatigue, visual inattention, cognitive inattention, and drowsy. This improved hypo-Driver system utilized trained behavioral features by a convolutional neural network (CNNs), recurrent neural network and long short-term memory (RNN-LSTM) model is used to extract physiological features. After fusion of these features, the Hypo-Driver system is classified hypo-V into five stages based on trained layers and dropout-layer in the deep-residual neural network (DRNN) model. To test the performance of a hypo-Driver system, data from 20 drivers are acquired. The results of Hypo-Driver compared to state-of-theart methods are presented. Compared to the state-of-the-art Hypo-V system, on average, the Hypo-Driver system achieved a detection accuracy (AC) of 96.5%. The obtained results indicate that the Hypo-Driver system based on multimodal and multiview features outperforms other state-of-the-art driver Hypo-V systems by handling many anomalies."	2022	5/20/2025 13:06	5/24/2025 12:18	5/20/2025 13:06	1999-2007		1	71			Hypo-Driver							en					DOI.org (Crossref)				C:\Users\LATITUDE E7470\Zotero\storage\A2FS8Z4I\Riquelme et al. - 2022 - Hypo-Driver A Multiview Driver Fatigue and Distraction Level Detection System.pdf		INCLUDED

In a study conducted by National Sleep Foundation, it has been found that about 20% of drivers feel drowsy during driving. These statistics paint a very scary picture. This paper proposes a system for driver drowsiness detection, in which the architecture detects sleepiness of driver. The proposed architecture consists of four deep learning models: AlexNet, VGG-FaceNet, FlowImageNet and ResNet, which use RGB videos of drivers as input and help in detecting drowsiness. Also, these models consider four types of different features such as hand gestures, facial expressions, behavioral features and head movements for the implementation. The AlexNet model is used for various background and environmental changes like indoor, outdoor, day and night. VGG-FaceNet is used to extract facial characteristics like gender ethnicities. FlowImageNet is used for behavioral features and head gestures, and ResNet is used for hand gestures. Hand gestures detection provides a precise and accurate result. These models classify these features into four classes: non-drowsiness, drowsiness with eye blinking, yawning and nodding.

Neural activity recorded by EEG electrodes is a widely used physiological correlate of driver drowsiness. This paper presents a novel dynamical modeling solution to estimate the instantaneous level of the driver drowsiness using EEG signals, where the PERcentage of eyelid CLOSure (PERCLOS) is employed as the ground truth of driver drowsiness. Applying our proposed modeling framework, we find neural features present in EEG data that encode PERCLOS. In the decoding phase, we use a Bayesian filtering solution to estimate the PERCLOS level over time. A data set that comprises 18 driving tests, conducted by 13 drivers, has been used to investigate the performance of the proposed framework. The modeling performance in estimation of PERCLOS provides robust and repeatable results in tests with manual and automated driving modes by an average RMSE of 0.117 (at a PERCLOS range of 0 to 1) and average High Probability Density percentage of 62.5%. We further hypothesized that there are biomarkers that encode the PERCLOS across different driving tests and participants. Using this solution, we identified possible biomarkers such as Theta and Delta powers. Results show that about 73% and 66% of the Theta and Delta powers which are selected as biomarkers are increasing as PERCLOS grows during the driving test.

More fatal accidents could be avoided if fatigued drivers were warned ahead of time. Several drowsiness detection technologies to monitor for signs of inattention while driving and notifying the driver can be adopted. Sensors in self-driving cars must detect if a driver is sleepy, angry, or experiencing extreme changes in their emotions, such as anger. These sensors must constantly monitor the driver’s facial expressions and detect facial landmarks in order to extract the driver’s state of expression presentation and determine whether they are driving safely. As soon as the system detects such changes, it takes control of the vehicle, immediately slows it down, and alerts the driver by sounding an alarm to make them aware of the situation. The proposed system will be integrated with the vehicle’s electronics, tracking the vehicle’s statistics and providing more accurate results.

Our contributed dataset (mEBAL2, multimodal EyeBlink and Attention Level estimation, Version 2) is the largest existing eyeblink database, representing a great opportunity to improve data-driven multispectral approaches for blink detection and related applications (e.g., attention level estimation). mEBAL2 includes 21,100 image sequences from 180 different students (more than 2 million labeled images in total) while conducting a number of e-learning tasks of varying difficulty or taking a real course on HTML initiation through the edX MOOC platform. mEBAL2 uses multiple sensors, including two Near-Infrared (NIR) and one RGB camera to capture facial gestures during the execution of the tasks, as well as an Electroencephalogram (EEG) band to get the cognitive activity of the user and blinking events. Furthermore, this work proposes 3 data-driven approaches as benchmarks for blink detection on mEBAL2, where the architecture based on Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) achieved performances of up to 99%. The experiments explored whether combining RGB and NIR spectrum data improves blink detection in training and architectures that merge both types of data. Experiments showed that the NIR spectrum enhances results, even when only RGB images are available during inference. Finally, the generalization capacity of the proposed eyeblink detectors, along with state-of-the-art eyeblink detection implementations, is validated in wilder and more challenging environments like the HUST-LEBW dataset to show the usefulness of mEBAL2 to train a new generation of data-driven approaches for eyeblink detection."	2024-06	5/20/2025 14:30	5/24/2025 12:27	5/20/2025 14:30	83-89			182		Pattern Recognition Letters	mEBAL2 database and benchmark							en					DOI.org (Crossref)				C:\Users\LATITUDE E7470\Zotero\storage\NIKCAY9L\Daza et al. - 2024 - mEBAL2 database and benchmark Image-based multispectral eyeblink detection.pdf		EXCLUDED - wrong population

This integrated approach consists of (i) Faster RCNN deep learning model to detect the face and eyes; (ii) AlexNet is utilized for eye openness detection using transfer learning; (iii) Rectangularintensity-gradient (RIG) is proposed for eye centre localization. Experimentations were performed on benchmark databases like GI4E and BioID. An accuracy of 97.50% and 94.25% for Nerr 0.05, 98.75% and 98.40% for Nerr 0.10, 99.64% and 99.45% for Nerr 0.25 was achieved across GI4E and BioID databases respectively. In addition, the robustness of the proposed approach was tested on AR and CAS-PEAL databases. The proposed approach of eye centre localization performs relatively better than existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational time."	2022-10	5/20/2025 14:30	5/24/2025 12:32	5/20/2025 14:30	7153-7167		9	34		Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences								en					DOI.org (Crossref)				C:\Users\LATITUDE E7470\Zotero\storage\P8X3F9XZ\Ahmad et al. - 2022 - An integrated approach for eye centre localization using deep networks and rectangular-intensity-gra.pdf		EXCLUDED - wrong population
